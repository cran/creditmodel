# creditmodel1.1.1
**In this version I have:**
* Fixed some potential bugs in `get_names`, `digits_num`

# creditmodel1.1.0

**In this version I have:**

* Add a function `data_exploration`  for data exploration.
* Fixed some potential bugs in `missing_proc`, `outliers_proc` ,`get_names` 
* In `lasso_filter`,  `AUC`&`K-S` is added to select the best lambda. In this way, not only can the set of variables that makes the AUC or K-S maximized be selected, but also the multicollinearity (which is difficult to eliminate by AIC in stepwise regression),  can be minimized. That means instead of stepwise regression, the optimal combination of variables can be selected by lasso to solve the regression problem.
* Visualize the number of variables, `K-S` or `AUC` values corresponding to different lambda.
* Provide new functions``auc_value`  \ `ks_value`,  which can calculate Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)  & AUC of multiple model results quickly.
